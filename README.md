# Police-Complaint-Management-System-using-Blockchain

Earlier all criminal records were maintained in a register which can be easily manipulated and time consuming process to transfer register data from one police station to other station. To overcome from above issue Online Criminal Tracking System was introduced which is managed by a single centralized servers, if this server is down then criminal tracking services will get disturbed and internal employee of server management can be manipulated easily and those manipulation cannot be detected easily. 

To overcome from above issue author of this paper proposing concept to migrate single centralized criminal tracking system to Blockchain based distributed system. Blockchain has inbuilt support for distributed data management and data verification which will not allow anybody to manipulate any records and all data stored in Blockchain are encrypted.

So by employing Blockchain technology we can overcome from all disadvantages faces during single centralized servers.
Blockchain utilize SOLODITY programs called ‘Smart Contract’ to allow users to call those functions to store or retrieve data from Blockchain. 

To implement this project we have designed following modules
1)	Admin: admin can login to application using username and password as ‘admin’ and ‘admin’. After login admin will add Police employees and then give username and password to each police personnel. Admin can view all added police personnel and can view all investigations reports.
2)	Police: police can login to application using username and password given by admin and then add new FIR and can add updated investigations and all other police station peoples can view all FIR and updated investigations.
